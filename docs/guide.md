## 🚀 How to Use

Follow these steps to safely optimize your display settings:

### 1. Choose a Tuning Profile
Select one of the three pre-calibrated presets that best fits your needs:
* **Standard Tuning**: Enhanced stability for daily multitasking.
* **Balanced Mode (Recommended)**: The perfect "sweet spot" between high-definition sharpness and touch sensitivity.
* **Pro Precision**: Elite-tier density for competitive tasks requiring maximum control and ultra-sharp graphics.

### 2. Manual Configuration (Advanced)
If you require a specific density not covered by the presets:
1. Locate the **Manual DPI Tuning** input field.
2. Enter your desired value (Valid range: **400 - 999**).
3. Ensure the value is correct to prevent UI scaling distortions.

### 3. Applying Settings
1. Review your selected profile or manual input.
2. Tap the **Apply Changes** button.
3. The configuration will be saved to your profile.
4. Launch your target application through the **Main Dashboard** for the settings to take effect.

### 4. Restoring System Defaults
If you wish to revert to your original screen scaling:
1. Open the configuration panel and select **Restore System Defaults**.
2. Verify your **Default DPI Value** in the input field.
3. Tap **Apply Changes** to return to factory settings.

* **Compatibility**: Display behavior may vary depending on your specific device manufacturer and Android version.
